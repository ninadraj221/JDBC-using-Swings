# JDBC-using-Swings
Swing is a GUI widget toolkit for JAVA. Here we have connected the GUI interface with the database. Tasks performed are ; inserting values to database and retrieving values in the form of JTable from the database.
Data base used here is my-sql. This is a simple program which illustrates connection between an application made using various components like JButton , JLabel, Action-Listener, JTextFields, JOptionPane class, JTable etc with the mysql database. We have smartly used an array to retrieve all the contents from the database (also the resultset object wasn't initialized to default we made it to move forward and to specific index value).
NOTE : Layout of the frame need not to be set when using JTable.
